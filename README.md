# Notes

denny:v0

use this to spin up a multi docker environment on elastic beanstalk.

As an optimization, its recommended to terminate the elastic beanstlk environment once you are done using it.
To ensure all automation scripts work as expected make sure that when you recreate the environment its named 'project-one'
